# SDLC Progress – Community Food Sharing Platform

## Overview

The *Community Food Sharing Platform* is being developed using a structured **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** approach. Each phase is documented to ensure systematic development, clear traceability, and alignment with software engineering best practices.

---

## Phase 1: Requirement Analysis ✅

**Status:** Completed

In this phase, the real-world problem of food waste and food insecurity was analyzed. The need for a community-driven, accessible food-sharing solution was identified by studying existing platforms and their limitations. Stakeholders and system users were defined, and high-level requirements were gathered.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Problem definition and feasibility analysis
- Identification of system users (Donor, Recipient, Admin)
- Initial functional and non-functional requirements
- Clear project scope definition

---

## Phase 2: Software Requirements Specification (SRS) ✅

**Status:** Completed

A detailed **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** document was created to formally define system behavior and constraints. The SRS captures system scope, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, assumptions, and limitations, following standard software engineering documentation practices.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Complete SRS document prepared
- Functional and non-functional requirements documented
- System scope and constraints defined
- User interactions clearly specified

📄 **Document:** `docs/SRS_Document.pdf`

---

## Phase 3: System Design & UML Modeling ✅

**Status:** Completed

System design was carried out using **UML modeling techniques** to visually represent system behavior and interactions. Use Case Diagrams and Sequence Diagrams were developed and embedded within the SRS to illustrate user roles, system functionality, and message flow.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Use Case Diagrams for all system actors
- Sequence Diagrams for core workflows:
  - User Registration
  - Food Listing
  - Food Claiming
- Improved clarity of system interactions before implementation

📄 **Included within:** `SRS_Document.pdf`

## Phase 4: Functional Workflow Definition ⏳

**Status:** Planned

This phase focuses on translating requirements and UML designs into clear, step-by-step functional workflows. While high-level interactions are captured through UML diagrams, detailed workflow documentation will be created to guide implementation and testing.

**Planned Outcomes:**
- Detailed user interaction workflows
- Mapping of workflows to functional requirements
- Improved implementation clarity

---

## Phase 5: Implementation Planning ⏳

**Status:** Planned

This phase involves preparing the system for development by finalizing the technology stack and defining the project structure. Development will follow a modular and scalable approach.

**Planned Activities:**
- Frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Backend API development using Node.js and Express
- Database design and integration using MongoDB
- Authentication and authorization implementation

---

## Phase 6: Testing Strategy ⏳

**Status:** Planned

Testing will be conducted to ensure the system meets functional, performance, and security requirements defined in the SRS.

**Planned Activities:**
- Unit testing of individual modules
- Integration testing of system components
- Functional testing based on SRS requirements
- Security and performance testing

---

## Phase 7: Deployment & Evaluation ⏳

**Status:** Planned

The final phase focuses on deploying the application to a free cloud hosting platform with HTTPS support and evaluating system performance in a real-world environment.

**Planned Activities:**
- Cloud deployment with HTTPS
- Final validation and documentation updates
- User feedback collection and evaluation

---

## Conclusion

The Community Food Sharing Platform follows a structured SDLC approach to ensure disciplined development and strong documentation. The completed phases establish a solid foundation for implementation, while the planned phases guide the project toward successful deployment and real-world usability.
