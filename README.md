# Community-Food-Sharing-Platform
The Community Food Sharing Platform is a web-based application that reduces food waste by connecting surplus food providers with nearby recipients. It enables food listing, location-based discovery, and coordinated pickup through a secure and scalable system developed using a structured SDLC approach.
