# Community Food Sharing Platform

## 1. Project Description
The Community Food Sharing Platform is a web-based application developed to minimize food waste by connecting individuals and organizations with surplus edible food to nearby recipients. The system enables donors to post food availability details, allows recipients to discover and claim food based on location, and facilitates direct coordination for food pickup. The project is designed and documented following a structured Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) approach.

---

## 2. Problem Statement
A significant amount of edible food is wasted due to the lack of coordination between food providers and individuals in need. Existing food-sharing solutions often rely on mobile applications, have restricted access, or lack community-oriented design. These limitations reduce accessibility and effectiveness in addressing food waste.

---

## 3. Objectives
- Reduce food wastage through efficient redistribution  
- Enable community-driven food sharing  
- Provide a simple and accessible web-based platform  
- Ensure secure and reliable user interaction  
- Design a scalable system for future expansion  

---

## 4. Scope of the System
The platform supports food donation and collection within a defined locality. Donors can list surplus food with relevant details, while recipients can browse and claim food based on proximity. The system focuses on coordination and communication rather than logistics or delivery services.

---

## 5. System Users
- **User:** Registers and accesses platform features  
- **Donor:** Posts food availability information  
- **Recipient:** Browses and claims food  
- **Administrator:** Manages users, listings, and platform activity

## 6. Functional Requirements
- User registration and authentication  
- Food listing with time and location details  
- Location-based food discovery  
- Food claiming functionality  
- Direct messaging between donors and recipients  
- Food listing status tracking  

---

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements
- Web-first and device-independent access  
- Scalability for multi-location expansion  
- Secure authentication and data handling  
- Usability-focused interface design
